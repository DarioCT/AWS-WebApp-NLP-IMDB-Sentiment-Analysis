# AWS-WebApp-NLP-IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project we will use Amazon's SageMaker service to construct a random tree model to predict the sentiment of a movie review. In addition, we will deploy this model to an endpoint and construct a very simple web app which will interact with our model's deployed endpoint.
